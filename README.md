# General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program
Awarded a scholarship to attend the General Assembly Software Engineering Immerisve Program. Throughout the program, I explored programming and computer science fundamentals, as well as software engineering best practices.
• Create a front-end web application with modern JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React.
• Develop and deploy full-stack applications with in-demand technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Python with Django, and Express with Node.js.
• Build secure full-stack applications by leveraging common design and architectural patterns like model–view–controller (MVC) and Representational State Transfer (REST).
• Practice version control and collaborative software development with Git and GitHub.
• Safely model and store data in SQL and NoSQL databases.
• Consume and integrate third-party application programming interfaces (APIs) in
an application.
• Prepare for the world of work, compiling a professional-grade portfolio of solo and group projects.

## Unit 1: Frontend Development
• Get acquainted with common developer tools (e.g., Chrome Developer Tools, text editors, code linters).
• Learn to navigate a computer file structure and configure development environments via a UNIX/ Linux command line.
• Solidify your knowledge of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are leveraged in software engineering (i.e., web typography, Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, responsive design).
• Dive into fundamental programming concepts (functions, control flow, variables, scope, etc.) using JavaScript.
• Start using Git and GitHub for version control.
• Learn and implement rigorous debugging
strategies.
• Start thinking algorithmically and breaking big
problems into smaller parts.
• Gain an introduction to project design, project
planning, and project management techniques engineers use on the job, including wireframes, user stories, and Agile development workflows

-----

## Unit 2: Springboot Backend Development
• Learned how to use Springboot backend framework.
• Learned Java programming concepts such as Object-Orientend Programming.
• Start writing recursive algorithms, as well as algorithms to solve computational problems such as sorting. Analyze algorithmic complexity using Big O Notation.
• Build web forms that collect user data for storage in a database (powered by PostgreSQL).
• Incorporate authentication capabilities into sites and applications (i.e., user logins, encrypted passwords, etc.).
• Gain an introduction to testing and test-driven development.
• Engage in pair programming to understand collaboration and documentation best practices.

----

## Unit 3: Angular Frontend Development
• Discover the capabilities that separate software engineers from coders, including the ability to plan, write, test, deploy, and launch a full-stack app using cutting-edge, next-gen technology.
• Deploy robust, modern front-end frameworks on which powerhouse platforms like Amazon and Facebook are built.
• Incorporate new patterns into front-end architecture, including custom behaviors, client- side models and data binding, form validation, and state management.
• Leverage the package managers and build tools regularly used by professional engineers.
• Get acquainted with more back-end libraries, frameworks, and tools that incorporate powerful front-end technologies like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
• Discover how to integrate third-party APIs into websites and applications (e.g., Stripe).
• Allow user login via token-based authentication and external accounts (i.e., social media, oAuth).
• Organize effective team workflows with Git and GitHub, refining technical and interpersonal collaboration skills.
